# 619 project synatx 

Here, I'll be posting my 619 project sytanx model by model. Broadly, my 619 project examined the longitudinal
and reciprocal relations between coparenting relationship quality and father engagement among low-income residential fathers. I
used a cross-lagged model to test the family systems theory which suggests that coparenting and father engagement share in a 
bidirectional relationship. I used a model building approach to create four models: (1) the stability model; (2) the father 
engagement unidirectional model; (3) the coparenting unidirectional model; and (4) bidirectional model. I compared these nested
models with the Satorra-Bentler LR test and AIC. Results demonstrated a preference for the third model. Thus, the coparenting 
unidirectional model was chosen as the final model. 

I did not include output in my syntax because the actual analyses were conducted in ICPSR's Virtual Data Enclave (VDE), where the restricted data is currently stored. The VDE does not allow users to manually add or extract content outside of its 
environment. My syntax here were re-typed by hand. The output is quite extensive so I could not include them here. For those 
interested in looking at output, please refer to the lavaan project at http://lavaan.ugent.be
