# 619 project synatx 

Here, I'll be posting my 619 project sytanx model by model. Broadly, my 619 project examined the longitudinal
and reciprocal relations between coparenting relationship quality and father engagement among low-income residential fathers. I
used a cross-lagged model to test the family systems theory which suggests that coparenting and father engagement share in a 
bidirectional relationship. I used a model building approach to create four models: (1) the stability model; (2) the father 
engagement unidirectional model; (3) the coparenting unidirectional model; and (4) bidirectional model. I compared these nested
models with the Satorra-Bentler LR test and AIC. Results demonstrated a preference for the third model. Thus, the coparenting 
unidirectional model was chosen as the final model.
